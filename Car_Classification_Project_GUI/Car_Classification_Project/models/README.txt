IMPORTANT NOTICE

The trained deep learning models used in this application are not included directly in this repository
due to GitHub file size limitations.

To run the application correctly, please download the following trained models and place them
inside this folder (Car_Classification_Project/models/):

1. efficientnetb4_best_model.keras
2. 1-inceptionv3-training-code.keras
3. resnet50_best.keras

After downloading, ensure that all model files are located in this directory before running the app.

Note:
These models were trained using the same dataset but with different preprocessing strategies,
corresponding to each architecture.
